Main Concepts
*************

After few years developping "basic" website, one can realize most of websites can be built thanks to few dozens of patterns.

In Stack It, those patterns are called *blocks*. A *page* "just" become a stack of those *blocks*.
We hereby get the two main Stack It's models: Block and Models

We aim at giving inline modification for everything.
Stack it's purpose is to:
- Manages pages, through the block approach.
- Expose Pages' & Blocks' content and parameters through a REST API.
- Deliver higly user friendly administration interface.
- Render Pages, handle redirection when a required.
- Gives you a structure for what in known regarding web developpement best pratices. We aim to devliver high quality standard code and methods. By the way, any insights is welcome!

The big word can be written down: Stack It a CMS.
Not a "does-whatever-you-want" CMS, but a developer, administrator & final user oriented.
Stack It does not intend to implement "click & install" plugins.
You want to customize something ? You're expected to code, which is the only way to get hihgly secured & efficient software.
